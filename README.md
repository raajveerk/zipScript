#ZipScript

Hi, Ya'll!

I might be the only person on this planet with this specific of a requirement but f* it!

ZipScript is nothing but a Python script and here's what it does:
1) It scrapes the "Downloads" folder of my laptop for any ".zip" files, every 2 hours.
2) If it does find a ".zip" file, it:
   --> reads the file name
   --> makes a new folder of the same name
   --> extracts all the files from the ".zip" folder to the newly created one
   --> recycles the ".zip" folder.

I can explain why I built this I'm not crazy xD. Hit me up at khattarraajveer@gmail.com ;)

Cheers!
